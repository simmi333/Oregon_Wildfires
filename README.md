Link to Shiny App: https://simmi333.shinyapps.io/wildfire-visualizer/


A interactive Shiny App of wildfires in the state of Oregon from years 2000 to 2022. Programmed on R Studio. 

Our group explores the casues of wildfires, the estiamtes of acres burned on different parts of Oregon, and the differences of amount of fires in early years vs. later. The idea of this app was to be useful for firefighters, scnetists, policy makers, and Oregon residents.



**DATA** accessed from (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/odf-fire-occurrence-data-2000-2022)

We will be working with the wildfires in Oregon dataset made by Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) at the government website (DATA.GOV.) This dataset includes data from 2000 to 2022 and records 23491 cases of
wildfires. In the case of a single wildfire, scientists can source the location, DistrictName, which unit it was; UnitName, how size of it; Size_class, and time data, and etc. This dataset can be used in
various fields and aspects, and it can simply act as an answer to our question. There are many information variables to record based on the different cases of wildfires in Oregon; however, we narrowed down the
datasat and only utilized the following: Fire Year, CauseBy, and HumanOrLightning.
